In Larabee and Chief Judge, the procedural posture of the cases is not so limiting and we may now issue a declaration.

Plaintiffs claim that, by this statement, we offered the State an opportunity to voluntarily grant retroactive pay raises to judges and signaled that, if the State did not provide such raises, we would return this matter to our "province" by ordering damages. But, in the aforementioned statement, we did not suggest that state judges have a judicially enforceable constitutional right to retroactive compensation increases, which must be supplied either by the voluntary action of the State or by a court order. Rather, in the referenced statement, we simply observed that we retain the continuing power to review the State\'s handling of judicial compensation for compliance with the separation of powers doctrine. Had we believed that the State had to compensate judges for the lack of pay increases during the years of linkage or else pay damages, we would have ordered the State to satisfy its alleged constitutional obligation to grant retroactive pay increases by paying damages to the plaintiffs in Matter of Maron, and we would not have given the State extra time to decide whether or not to provide the backpay that was, according to plaintiffs, owed to them under the constitution. Of course, the Legislature was free to provide for retroactive pay increases, but our decision in that case did not mandate such action.\r\n', '\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t']

Notably, this transfer was later invalidated by the Ohio Supreme Court in an indemnity action between Glidden and certain comprehensive general liability insurers. That Court held that Hanson was not a named insured in the relevant policies and consequently could not transfer the policies to ICI American Holdings (see Glidden Co. v Lumbermens Mut. Cas.

Apparently, plaintiffs in the Lead Cases made distinctions between lead-based paint and lead-pigment manufacturers, generally pursuing lead-pigment manufacturers rather than lead-based paint manufacturers due to difficulty in determining the actual manufacturers for the paint at issue.\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 8: As mentioned, this decision also invalidated Hanson's Side Letter Agreement attempting to provide ICI American Holdings with the benefits of SCM's insurance policies.\r\n", '\r\nFootnote 9: Subsequently, in January 2009, Millennium filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy.\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 10: Specifically, ANP counterclaimed for a declaration that it was not obligated to indemnify Millennium for pigment-related claims. It also alleged that Millennium had made misrepresentations in the 1986 Purchase Agreement which entitled it to set-off any indemnification claims. Additionally, ANP asserted two causes of action for breach of Millennium's contractual obligation to indemnify ANP.\r\n", '\r\nFootnote 11: The Insurers assert that they have paid over $15 million to Millennium in connection with the Lead Cases.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 12: Prior to oral argument on the summary judgment motions in Supreme Court, an Ohio state trial court decided a pending action, wherein the Insurers sought to recoup their respective contributions to the Santa Clara Settlement from Millennium. The court held that the Insurers\' settlement payment in the Santa Clara action was not required under the relevant policies, and thus was a voluntary payment. The court there reasoned that because the nuisance claim advanced by the Santa Clara plaintiffs was for "remediation of a public health hazard" not "an action for damages for injuries caused to plaintiffs\' property," coverage for that claim was unavailable because the policies issued by the Insurers covered property damage, rather than public health hazards. Thus, the court concluded that because the Insurers were not required to make the settlement payment, they were not entitled to reimbursement from Millennium of their $3.2 million contribution. The Insurers did not appeal this Ohio court order.\r\n', '\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t']

Partnership I v Town/Village of Harrison, 162 AD2d 674, 675 [2d Dept 1990], citing Matter of Twenty First Point Co. v Town of Guilderland, 101 AD2d 407 [3d Dept 1984], affd 64 NY2d 954 [1985]).\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 2: The court excluded any taxes collected by the School District in 2008 from this order because the court concluded, based on the evidence presented, that the taxes collected by the School District in 2008 used the 2007 assessment roll.\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 3: The Appellate Division order only addressed the 2008 through 2011 assessment rolls. Therefore, the portion of the Supreme Court's order directing tax refunds for 2012 through 2014 was not disturbed.\r\n", '\r\nFootnote 4: In Matter of Scellen, the Appellate Division held that, in order for a judicially reduced assessment to be subject to the three-year assessment valuation freeze under RPTL 727, petitioner must file petitions challenging the assessment value in each of the three years subject to the freeze. Recently, another Appellate Division Department declined to follow Matter of Scellen (see Matter of the Torok Trust v Town Bd. of Town of Alexandria, 128 AD3d 97 [4th Dept 2015]). Notably, however, neither of these decisions addresses RPTL 485-b, the statute at issue here.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 5: The dissent takes issue with our assertion that the exemption is calculated using a single assessment roll, claiming "this will not always be the case" and citing to RPTL 485-b (2) (a) (ii) (see dissenting op. at 12). RPTL 485-b (2) (a) (ii) provides an automatic adjustment to the exemption amount when the assessed value of the land increases or decreases by "fifteen percent or more" in any year in which the exemption applies. As the dissent does not and cannot deny, here, the assessed value of the land never increased or decreased by fifteen percent or more, so 485-b (2) (a) (ii) was never implicated. Of even greater importance, the automatic adjustment under RPTL 485-b (2) (a) (ii) applies regardless of whether a petition is filed to challenge the exemption amount. Since this provision applies with or without the filing of a petition, it has no bearing on our analysis.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 6: The dissent attempts to undercut the significance of the fact that the petition was timely provided to the School District in 2008, affording the School District not only the opportunity to intervene, but to anticipate the potential impact if petitioner\'s challenge to the exemption calculation was successful. The dissent suggests the petition was ambiguous because "[a]side from citing to RPTL 485-b, the petition provided no indication that any assessments other than the 2008 assessment were at issue" (dissenting op. at 2). School Districts are, of course, deemed to be aware of the impact of an RPTL 485-b exemption. In fact, RPTL 485-b (1) affords school districts the opportunity to opt out of the business investment exemption, which the School District had not done here. Because the business investment exemption spans multiple years and is calculated using a single assessment roll, it should have been clear to the School District that a challenge to the calculation of this exemption would change the exemption amount in all years in which the exemption applied. Thus, the dissent\'s position is belied by the very nature of the RPTL 485-b exemption.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 7: Notably, none of the cases the dissent cites for this proposition concern RPTL 485-b and its ten-year exemption. For example, the dissent cites People ex rel. Hilton v Fahrenkopf (279 NY 49, 52-53 [1938]) and Vantage Petroleum, Bay Isle Oil Co. v Board of Assessment Review of Town of Babylon (61 NY2d 695, 698 [1984]) to the effect that "[e]ach annual proceeding is separate and distinct from every other"; those cases therefore held that res judicata does not apply from one year to the next because each assessment is different. But precisely the opposite is true with respect to the ten-year exemption provided under RPTL 485-b. Because there is "only one tax exemption which is applied over a 10-year period," in Schulman Master Ltd. Partnership I v Town/Village of Harrison (162 AD2d 674, 675 [2d Dept 1990]), in which succeeding property owners attempted to challenge a RPTL 485-b exemption that their predecessors had unsuccessfully challenged three years earlier, the Appellate Division found that res judicata applied to defeat the subsequent action (id. at 675-76).\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 8: The dissent's discussion of RPTL 727 misses our point about this section, which is that it demonstrates the legislature's desire to decrease the amount of tax certiorari litigation. We agree with both petitioner and the School District that it is unnecessary even to address RPTL 727 to decide this appeal. We note, however, that the dissent's interpretation of RPTL 727, which adopts that in Matter of Scellen (300 AD2d 979), was recently rejected in Matter of the Torok Trust v Town Bd. of Town of Alexandria (128 AD3d 97 [4th Dept 2015]), as referenced above.\r\n", '\r\nFootnote 9: Petitioner apparently did not apply for the exemption until 2008, well beyond the one-year statutory deadline (see RPTL 485-b [3]). Because the exemption was granted nonetheless, and no party argued in the courts below or in this Court that the application was untimely, that issue is not before us.\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 10: However, in the event of a change in the property's assessment equal to or greater than 15% during the exemption period, the statute provides a separate formula and process for calculating a new exemption base and, accordingly, a new exemption amount (see RPTL 485-b [2] [a] [ii]).\r\n", u"\r\nFootnote 11: For this reason, the Legislature's amendment of RPTL\r\n485-b (to provide that the exemption amount for each year be derived from the exemption base established in the first year in order to alleviate the assessor's burden of reassessing an eligible property every year) is irrelevant to the question presented here \x97 that is, whether a challenge to the computation of the exemption, which may be applied to successive years, necessitates successive proceedings during the pendency of the challenge.\r\n", '\r\nFootnote 12: This underlying principle is similarly reflected in (1) the Uniform Rules for the New York State Trial Courts, which require that "a separate note of issue shall be filed for each property for each tax year" (22 NYCRR 202.59 [d] [2]; 202.60 [e] [2]), and (2) RPTL 710, which provides for easy consolidation of RPTL proceedings to facilitate efficient and economical review of related or successive petitions.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 13: Such factor is implicated with an RPTL 485-b exemption, as well since, as previously noted, the exemption base derived from the first assessment may be recalculated if the assessed value fluctuates by 15% or more (see RPTL 485-b [2] [a] [ii]).\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 14: The majority presupposes that an exemption that could potentially be applicable to multiple tax years will necessarily be awarded for that entire period.

However, there was no factual dispute as to the existence of those factors, and the RAI reflected that "0" points were assessed for both. Therefore, County Court had every reason to find the existence of the factors was established by defendant. The issue here is whether County Court properly exercised its discretion "to determine whether the totality of the circumstances warrant[ed] a departure" (Gillotti, 23 NY3d at 861).

[emphasis added]; Gillotti, 23 NY3d at 861). Therefore, even where the factor in question is explicitly considered in the calculation of an offender\'s RAI score, if the court concludes it is "not adequately taken into account," a court may consider it further in determining whether to depart.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 5:While I might agree with the majority that we can presume the Appellate Division correctly applied the law because it rendered its opinion after this Court decided Gillotti, that presumption is at odds with the Appellate Division\'s summary opinion here. The Appellate Division affirmed "for reasons stated" by County Court, and without at least a citation to Gillotti there is no reason to presume that the court applied the proper standard.

The form also indicates that the DNA profile from the gun was reviewed not by Huyck but by another analyst who did an evaluation of the associated data and the positive and negative controls.\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 2: The premise that DNA typing and the generation of the DNA profile is software driven and needs no independent manual evaluation by the trained analysts is both unsupported by the record, including Huyck's testimony and the laboratory reports detailing the editing process attending the generation of the DNA profiles, and scientifically unsound. This meritless premise is also quite contrary to standard laboratory protocols including OCME's protocols for the GeneMapper Identifier used in this case. Any claim that the machine-generated results from the gas chromatograph test admitted into evidence in Bullcoming required more independent evaluation and less skill, specialized knowledge and training than a DNA analyst generating a DNA profile is similarly scientifically unsound.\r\n", "\r\nFootnote 3: The lab reports for defendant's exemplar state that there was an electrophoresis failure involving a drop-out of alleles in all samples (including defendant's exemplar) at the same loci so, for quality control, the samples were all reamplified and run again in the electrophoresis instrument in order to generate the DNA profile. This may explain why there were two more analysts used for defendant's exemplar.\r\n", '\r\nFootnote 4: Contrary to the position taken by the dissent, this case is not analogous to Williams, or Brown for that matter, unless one eschews the pivotal fact that defendant was not only an identified suspect, but was charged with the possession of the very gun that the lab was subsequently asked to test. And, unlike Williams, the reports of the DNA profiles were admitted into evidence for their truth. Further, the plurality in Williams formulated a narrow primary purpose test for testimonial hearsay that would include this case, and conspicuously did not categorically exempt DNA laboratory reports from the Confrontation Clause. Although Justice Breyer, in his concurring opinion, discussed the possible solution of a presumptive exception for DNA reports, it was conditioned on the ability to allow the defendant to call the analysts on his or her own behalf, a proposal that might prove as onerous as an "all analysts" rule.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 5: The laboratory report in Melendez-Diaz was from the "State Laboratory Institute, a division of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health" (see 557 US at 346). The testifying witness in Bullcoming was from "the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Division" (see 564 US at 652-653). The dissent relies heavily on the fact that OCME, affiliated with the NYC Department of Health and Hygiene, and given its role as a medical examiner, is a government agency independent of law enforcement for purposes of the People\'s discovery obligation under CPL article 240. This relationship was a factor in the primary purpose test considered in Pealer (20 NY3d at 454-455). However, since the predominant purpose of OCME\'s Forensic Biology Department is to provide DNA testing on crime scene evidence for the New York City Police and prosecutors, the independent nature of the agency does not exclude it from the primary purpose test. To be sure, if the label of "independent agency" was controlling, Bullcoming would have been decided differently and we would have exempted OCME from our Confrontation Clause analysis long ago. Any emphasis on this factor in this particular case is unpersuasive as the evidence was submitted to the lab for testing during a pending criminal action. The preparation of these DNA profiles was not ancillary to the future prosecution of an unknown defendant (see 20 NY3d at 455).\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 6: To the extent the dissent supposes that DNA typing does not involve the independent analysis of a trained expert, we note that Justice Breyer\'s concurrence in Williams, relied upon by the dissent, cites the following description which proves otherwise:\r\n"Using the proper computer software, we properly transcribed the data produced by the electropherogram into a report. We applied the proper criteria to review the computer determinations of what the allele values are at each of the chromosomal locations analyzed. We properly documented those allele values to produce the DNA profile" (132 S Ct at 2254 [Appendix] [internal quotation marks omitted]).\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 7: The present case involved a single source 16 loci DNA profile. This record does not provide a basis to review issues which may arise in the more complex interpretation of DNA profiles from mixtures or in high sensitivity DNA analysis. We note that the amicus curiae brief by the Innocence Network provides examples of wrongful convictions attributed to the misinterpretation of DNA profiles by analysts derived from mixture samples (see Innocence Network brief at 26-29). The complexity in the calling of alleles by the analyst in mixture and high sensitivity DNA samples while using the DNA typing computer software undermines any position favoring the use of experts who play no part in the generation of the DNA profile in the final stage of the DNA typing process.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 8: As a practical matter, in this case, "shoddy or dishonest work" (see Williams, 132 S Ct at 2239) would appear unlikely to result in an exact match to defendant\'s own DNA profile. \r\n', '\r\nFootnote 9: There is also the option that, when a prosecution approaches trial, a single analyst, who was not involved in the original tests, may participate in the generation of DNA profiles during a retest of the samples, if same are available.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 10: The dissent would hold that, if the DNA profiles are testimonial, every analyst involved in generating the profiles must be produced for cross-examination (see dissenting op. at 34). This sweeping conclusion is reached without citation and, as noted above, is inconsistent with the weight of authority, including the Williams plurality opinion.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 1: A DNA analysis sometimes contains information, described as peaks and not actually part of the sample, that is essentially a byproduct of the sensitive DNA testing process. This information is edited out of the DNA analysis automatically by the testing software or by an analyst after the program is complete. If an analyst removes the information, a second analyst reviews the decision to confirm that the action was appropriate.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 2: The laboratory file admitted into evidence in Brown contained 72 pages, of which 29 pages related to the process performed at Bode (see Brown, 13 NY3d at 338 n 2). \r\n', '\r\nFootnote 3: To the extent the material at issue documents the match between the DNA profile developed from the buccal swab and that developed from the gun swabs, introduction of those reports was harmless as Huyck, who performed that comparison and is listed on those documents, testified in court (see Rawlins, 10 NY3d at 160 [the People relied on court witness to prove the DNA match making admission of notification of match as a business record harmless beyond a reasonable doubt]; see also id. at 157 [admission of testimonial fingerprint comparison report harmless in that testifying expert reached the same conclusion after comparing the latent prints]).\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 4: There is some ambiguity as to what is meant by "defendant\'s DNA profile," but it appears intended to be both the profile from the buccal swab and the one generated from the gun swabs.\r\n', u'\r\nFootnote 5: It is unclear whether an autopsy report such as that admitted in Freycinet would now pass constitutional muster given that a medical examiner\'s office will perform the procedure and a murder suspect may have been identified. The majority attempts to cast this concern as "misplaced," stating: "We are not retreating from our prior decisions holding that, given the primary purpose of a Medical Examiner in conducting autopsies, such redacted reports \x97 \'a contemporaneous, objective account of observable facts that [do] not link the commission of the crime to a particular person\' \x97 are not testimonial" (majority op at 31, quoting Pealer, 20 NY3d at 454). This appears but one more attempt to find an arbitrary stopping place for that retreat and, as with other attempts to do so, cannot be squared with the constitutional analysis of the majority opinion or the language of our case law (see Freycinet, 11 NY3d at 42 ["a report of a doctor\'s findings at an autopsy may reflect more exercise of judgment than the report of a DNA technician"]).\r\n', '\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t']

This comment appears to be a mere rephrasing of the dissent\'s argument that defendant lacked a practical opportunity to raise his current claim before the court of first instance. We simply disagree because the record discloses several instances where, in light of the court\'s comments and the course of the proceedings, the defense could have made an objection based on, or sought clarification of, the legality of a three-year prison term upon his conviction. If the dissent means to suggest that defendant did not have to preserve his claim, regardless of any opportunity to do so, because the record does not affirmatively reveal that he and his attorney had actual knowledge that the court committed an alleged error, such an assertion is untenable. Although we have excused the failure to use the objection method of preservation to preserve a claim of a fundamental defect in a plea based in part on the lack of an opportunity for the defendant to have discovered the error, we have never held, either in the plea context or elsewhere, that the defendant\'s lack of actual knowledge that an error has occurred, despite an opportunity to learn of the error, may excuse the defendant from having to preserve his or her claim via objection. Indeed, such a theory would swallow the preservation doctrine whole, thereby eviscerating an essential limit on our jurisdiction (see People v Turriago, 90 NY2d 77, 80 [1997]; People v Kelly, 5 NY3d 116, 119 [2005]), because virtually every defendant could rely on a record silent on the subject of the defendant\'s actual knowledge to argue that he or she did not in fact comprehend the erroneous nature of the court\'s actions and therefore had no obligation to object. We reject this sweeping knowledge-based exception to the preservation rule. \r\n', "\r\nFootnote 3: Notably, the Legislature is aware that illegal sentences may sometimes be imposed and has created a mechanism to address this problem. That mechanism, CPL 440.40, authorizes the court, upon the People's motion, to vacate an illegal sentence within one year of imposition. Had defendant received the illegal sentence that was to his benefit on his third-degree drug sale conviction, the People would have had only one year to move to vacate the illegal sentence (see Campbell v Pesce, 60 NY2d 165, 168-69 [1983]).\r\n", u'\r\nFootnote 1: The correct sentence was a determinate term between 6 and 15 years, followed by a term of post-release supervision between 1\xbd and 3 years (see Penal Law \xa7 70.70[4][b][i]).\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 2: It is worth noting that defendant was sentenced in January of 2012. If he had replead at that point to the originally agreed on three-year sentence, his sentence would already be complete. \r\n', "\r\nFootnote 3: The Court's holding in People v DeValle (94 NY2d 870 [2000]), is not to the contrary. In that case, the Court held that the trial court had inherent power to correct an illegal sentence where defendant did not seek withdrawal of the plea, and also failed to establish detrimental reliance on the illegal sentence that could not be addressed by returning him to his pre-plea status, if he so desired. Here, defendant seeks the remedy the Court in DeValle recognized as appropriately available to the defendant on the facts of that case. Thus, unlike the defendant in DeValle who, in essence, demanded specific performance of an illegal sentence, defendant here seeks no more than what the law allows, namely to be returned to his pre-plea status.\r\n", '\r\nFootnote 4: The Majority is incorrect in its assertion that allowing defendant to bring a direct claim would "swallow the preservation doctrine whole" (majority op. at 16 fn 2). Here, defendant should be absolved from the normal preservation rules, not solely because he lacked actual knowledge of the error, as the Majority asserts, but because he relied on an assertion of the trial judge that the plea offer was based on a legal minimum sentence. When a court\'s statement creates the perception that no further investigation of a sentence is needed, defendant cannot be held responsible for relying on that statement.\r\n', '\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t']

Thus, the father\'s conduct of maintaining the open phone line and listening to the communications is, itself, a violation of the statutes and no distinction need be drawn here between that act and the act of recording.\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 3: For example, while the majority asserts that the child's age is a factor to be taken into account, its holding raises, but does not answer, the question of whether a parent's vicarious consent can override that of an older child who explicitly refuses to allow a parent to listen in or record a conversation with the other parent. Furthermore, the majority's holding does not apply only to situations in which the third party to the conversation is the child's other parent or step-parent. For instance, it can logically be extended to conversations between teenagers and their friends, as well as anyone else with whom the minor interacts.\r\n", '\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t']

CLASH has abandoned that point inasmuch as it acknowledges in its main brief on this appeal that it does not dispute that question (see generally JF Capital Advisors, LLC v Lightstone Group, LLC, 25 NY3d 759, 766 n 2 [2015]).\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 4:\tThose failed efforts considered such places as school auditoriums, sports arenas, commercial stores, public elevators, school or college classrooms, and public areas of health care institutions (see id.).\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 5:\tAlthough we do not reach the merits of this contention, we note that the "sugary drinks" case is easily distinguishable from this matter. In the "sugary drinks" case we held "that the New York City Board of Health, in adopting the  Sugary Drinks Portion Cap Rule,\' exceeded the scope of its regulatory authority" inasmuch as it chose "among competing policy goals, without any legislative delegation or guidance" (Matter of New York Statewide Coalition of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce, 23 NY3d at 690). There, instead of banning sugary drinks entirely, the Board of Health decided to restrict portions by reducing their consumption size, thereby adopting a "compromise that attempted to promote a healthy diet without significantly affecting the beverage industry" (id. at 698). No such considerations are evident here inasmuch as the regulation at issue merely prohibits smoking in designated outdoor areas under the jurisdiction of OPRHP.\r\nWe also pause to note another point of distinction, namely, the dissimilarity of the facts of Boreali (71 NY2d 1) to those of this matter. As noted, in Boreali we held "that the [PHC] overstepped the boundaries of its lawfully delegated authority when it promulgated a comprehensive code to govern tobacco smoking in areas that are open to the public" (id. at 6). In doing so we concluded that the regulatory structure prohibited smoking in a wide variety of indoor areas open to the public (see id. at 7) pursuant to a scheme "laden with exceptions based solely upon economic and social concerns," including "exemptions . . . for bars, convention centers, small restaurants, and the like . . . based on financial hardship" (id. at 12 [emphasis added]). Those financial considerations had "no foundation in considerations of public health" and "demonstrate[d] the [PHC\'s] own effort to weigh the goal of promoting health against its social cost and to reach a suitable compromise" (id.). No such considerations are evident here inasmuch as the regulation at issue merely prohibits smoking in designated outdoor areas under the jurisdiction of OPRHP.\r\n', '\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t']

Roblee is distinguishable, however, because the Appellate Division in that case concluded that the trial court\'s blanket exclusion of prospective jurors who had been accused or convicted of domestic violence, or any crime, deprived the defendant of his right to have the jury "\'selected at random from a fair cross section of the community\'" (id. at 228, quoting Judiciary Law \xa7 500). In addition, the defense attorney in Roblee specifically objected to the court\'s procedure (see Roblee, 70 AD3d at 229). Finally, the court\'s improper procedure in Roblee addressed the prospective jurors\' fitness to serve (see CPL 270.15), as opposed to hardship (see Roblee, 70 AD3d at 229-230).\r\n', u"\r\nFootnote 4: The overall thrust of the People's theory on summation \x97 that defendant was jealous of the victim's relationship with Tony Mann and the crime was perpetrated by a jealous person (as opposed to a stranger, which was the defense's theory) \x97 was entirely proper in light of the People's evidence. That evidence was that defendant had harassed the victim over the telephone for several months, and that seven months before the incident at issue on this appeal, defendant physically attacked the victim because of the victim's relationship with Mann. \r\n", '\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t']

Such "substitution[s] of a neutral word for a defendant\'s name" are permissible only if made "in a way that resemble[] a statement that a declarant might actually have made if he [or she] had been trying to avoid specifically identifying a confederate" (id. at 59). In Jass, "the redaction of [defendant\'s] name from [codefendant\'s] confession and the substitution of neutral words such as \'another person\'" was upheld because \x97 unlike the redacted statement at issue here \x97 the redaction "effectively concealed from the jury the fact that [codefendant] had \'refer[red] directly to someone\'" (id., quoting Gray v Maryland,523 US 185, 196 [1998]).\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 3: Defendant did not argue before the trial court, as he does here, that precinct showups are inherently suggestive.\r\n', '\r\nFootnote 1: I question whether Villanueva\'s statement even falls within Bruton\'s protections since it did not identify defendant by name or specific description. It identified him only by an article of clothing, when it said that "one of the Latin Kings wearing red & white trunks pulled out a knife and rushed the whole crowd." That fact alone makes this statement substantively different from the ones at issue in Bruton and Gray, which directly identified the defendant by name (see Bruton, 391 US at 124; Gray, 523 US at 192), as well as the statement in Harrington v California, which identified the defendant as a "white guy" and gave a description of his age, height, weight and hair color (395 US 250, 253 [1969]). Although the Court in Gray said that "nicknames and specific descriptions" fall within Bruton\'s scope, it has yet to apply a Bruton analysis to a statement like Villanueva\'s that identifies the defendant only by brief reference to the color of his shorts (id. at 195 [emphasis added]).\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 2: The trial court in this case did not instruct the jury to use the redacted statement only against codefendant Villanueva, but defendant did not object to the court's instruction and does not challenge it here. Therefore, the adequacy of the court's charge in the context of the alleged Bruton error is not before us (see People v Hawkins, 11 NY3d 484, 491-492 [2009]).\r\n", '\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t']

To the extent the dissent suggests that codefendant did not admit possession of illicitly obtained money because he did not use the term "pre-recorded" (see dissent op at 4 n 1), the record tells a different story and establishes that when asked about "prerecorded buy money in your pants pocket" codefendant acknowledged the money found on him as such, and never denied possession, choosing instead to explain how it ended up in his pocket.\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 2:The dissent argues that codefendant's statement was in actuality favorable to defendant (dissent op at 6).

With the exception of Detective Corey's deposition testimony, the record does not indicate whether or when the detectives learned of the autopsy results. At his deposition in the eventual civil action here, Detective Corey revealed that he had become aware of the autopsy results at some unspecified point in time.\r\n", "\r\nFootnote 2: In opposition to defendants' summary judgment motion in the instant civil actions, plaintiff submitted a police report indicating that a neighbor had told the detectives that, on the night of the crime, the neighbor had heard footsteps on the roof.\r\n", '\r\nFootnote 3: Immediately prior to the start of Corey\'s deposition, counsel for the City acknowledged on the record that he represented Corey and appeared on Corey\'s behalf "without any jurisdictional defenses or anything like that or statute of limitations."\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 4: In this context, the individual defendants are Detectives Corey, Guerra, Hendricks and Santiago, as the instant lawsuits were dismissed against the remaining named individual defendants on procedural grounds. Additionally, while the nisi prius court removed Corey from the case based on plaintiff's failure to enter a default judgment against him, the court's decision in that respect was erroneous for reasons that will be discussed later in this opinion. Thus, plaintiff's claims against the detectives remain viable only against Corey, Guerra, Hendricks and Santiago.\r\n", "\r\nFootnote 5: Based on plaintiff's counsel's questioning of Detective Santiago at her deposition, it appears that Santiago testified before the grand jury that, on October 25, 2002, plaintiff had admitted to her that plaintiff and Acuna had a sexual relationship. However, at the deposition, Santiago's recollection of that grand jury testimony was not refreshed. Furthermore, defendants did not cite this portion of Santiago's grand jury testimony, or even the excerpt of the deposition in which she was asked about it, in support of their summary judgment motion, nor did they argue that Santiago had been aware of plaintiff's sexual relationship with Acuna prior to her confession. As a result, defendants' current argument to that effect is unpreserved (see generally Toure v Avis Rent a Car Sys., 98 NY2d 345, 351 n3 [2002]).\r\n", "\r\nFootnote 6: In this respect, Lieutenant Vilardi's more specific report about the polygraph results, which was drafted days after plaintiff's arrest and cited by defendants in their summary judgment motion, does not eliminate all triable issues of fact regarding the conclusions reached by Vilardi and the detectives at the time of the arrest, rather than thereafter.\r\n", "\r\nFootnote 7: Whether certain interrogation practices are legally permissible is to be decided on a case-by-case basis. All we decide here is that plaintiff's account of the impact of the detectives' interrogation techniques on her decision to sign the confession contributed to triable issues of fact in connection with her false arrest and malicious prosecution claims.\r\n", '\r\nFootnote 8: In relying on plaintiff\'s testimony that she signed the confession only in response to the detectives\' lengthy interrogation of her and their commanding and cajoling her to confess, we do not decide on summary judgment that the evidence is legally insufficient to support a fact finder\'s conclusion that the police had probable cause to arrest plaintiff based upon the confession, nor do we opine that the confession was involuntarily made as a matter of law. Indeed, as we explain later in this opinion, plaintiff, like defendants, has not established entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. At bottom, our decision here is grounded on the long-established principle that "where it is demonstrated that there is a dispute about . . . the inferences to be drawn by a reasonable person from the facts which led to the [arrest or] prosecution, the uniform rule has been to require there be a factual resolution at a trial" (Munoz, 18 NY2d at 11).\r\n', "\r\nFootnote 9: Aside from an oblique reference to the issue in their brief, defendants do not directly assert that the suppression court's ruling on the voluntariness of plaintiff's confession should entirely estop plaintiff from asserting that her confession was involuntary and false. And, defendants did not preserve such a claim below. Under these circumstances, we decline to address any collateral estoppel issues in this case.\r\n", '\r\nFootnote 10: In Colon v New York (60 NY2d 78), we suggested that a police officer might be liable for hiding material exculpatory evidence from, or providing false evidence to, "either . . . the Grand Jury or . . . the District Attorney" (id. at 82-83 [emphasis added]). But, in making this observation, we did not rule that a police officer\'s testimony per se, as distinct from his or her provision of fabricated evidence to the prosecuting authority in a manner designed to commence the prosecution in the first instance, is generally an appropriate basis in itself for liability for malicious prosecution. Rather, our comment was consistent with the rule of immunity applicable to a "complaining witness" under the common law. Indeed, as the Supreme Court of the United States recently explained, the common law has long regarded a person who instigates a prosecution as the "complaining witness" and hence permits a suit against that person based on his or her non-testimonial conduct in commencing the prosecution, but common-law principles nonetheless cloak a witness in the grand jury, including a law enforcement agent who acts as a "complaining witness," with immunity in connection with his or her testimony (see Rehberg, 132 S Ct at 1502-1510).\r\n', '\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t']
